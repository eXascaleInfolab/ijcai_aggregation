\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Finding social influencers is a fundamental task for many online applications, ranging from brand
marketing to opinion mining. Existing methods are mainly based on supervised learning techniques,
whose performance is heavily limited by the availability of expert labels (often limited). In
contrast to experts, the crowd possesses more complete knowledge -- on an aggregated level -- of
influencers in many domains, such as fashion and fitness. Individual crowd workers, however, only
possess fragmented knowledge that is often of low-quality. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively find social influencers by asking the crowd in the form of open-ended questions. In
particular, we develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework and a variational
inference algorithm, which are able to infer the true influencers from fragmented crowd
contributions while learning the reliability of individual crowd workers. Experimental results on
real-world datasets show that our proposed framework substantially improves the state of the art.
