We have identified a new problem of open-ended answers aggregation in the context of social influencer finding. We presented \sys, a new probabilistic learning and inference framework for open-ended answers aggregation. Our framework aggregates open-ended answers while modeling both the quality of workers' answers and the reliability of workers. We derived an efficient variational inference algorithm for learning \sys parameters. Extensive validation on two real-world datasets show that \sys is an effective and robust framework that substantially improves the state-of-the-art answer aggregation performance.
